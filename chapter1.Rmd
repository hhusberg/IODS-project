# About the project

## A short description

This seems to be the course I've been looking for. The three-fold message in the title refers to important aspects of how I wish to conduct my own research (_Open Data, Open Science and Data Science_). The way it's set up is also promising. Let's see how it goes!

What I hope to learn during the course is:
* How to analyse data with R
* How to find more information on how to use R
* How to analyze large, open data-sets

Oh, and my repository is [here](https://github.com/hhusberg/IODS-project)
