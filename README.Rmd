# Something about the course

This course is called Open Data Science. During the course I hope to learn to use R, but also to understand statistical analyses better. As stated in the [course description](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/SocStats/Introduction+to+Open+Data+Science,+spring+2017) data today is 
```_larger than ever and complex like chaos_```

I hope this course will help me see some order in that chaos.
